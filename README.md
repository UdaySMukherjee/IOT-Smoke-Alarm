# IOT-Smoke-Alarm

Welcome to the DIY Arduino Smoke Alarm project! This repository contains all the resources you need to build a smart smoke alarm system using an Arduino ESP32. This device will not only sound an alarm when smoke is detected but also send an email notification to keep you informed wherever you are.

## Materials Needed:

ESP32: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/esp-wroom-32-wifi-bluetooth-networking-smart-component-development-board/)

MQ-2 Smoke Sensor: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/waveshare-mq-2-gas-sensor/)

Relay Module: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/12v-1-channel-relay-module/)

Buzzer: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/piezo-electronic-buzzer-beep-alarm-bell-continuous-sound-3v-24v-buzzer-electromagnetic/)

Fan: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/12v-4010-cooling-fan-for-3d-printer/)

Breadboard: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/transparent-400-points-solderless-breadboard/)

Jumper Wires: [Buy](https://robu.in/product/65pcs-flexible-breadboard-jumper/)

## Features:
Smoke Detection: Uses the MQ-2 sensor to detect smoke and flammable gases.
Email Notifications: Sends an email alert when smoke is detected, ensuring you are notified even if you are not at home.
Buzzer Alert: Sounds an audible alarm to alert nearby individuals of smoke.
